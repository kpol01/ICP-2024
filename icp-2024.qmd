# Some Statistical Tests for Goodness of Fit

## Chi-square Goodness of Fit Test

Let $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \sim F(.)$ independently.

We consider mutually exclusive and exhaustive classes $C_1, C_2,...,C_k$ such that 

$$\mathbb{P}(X \in C_i) = p_i$$
We want to test the hypothesis,

$$H_0:p_i = p_i^0 , \text{for all } i \quad \text{vs} \quad H_1 : p_i \neq p_i^0, \text{for at least one } i$$

Let $f_i$ be the observed frequency of the $i^{th}$ class in the sample. Then the chi-square test statistic is given by
